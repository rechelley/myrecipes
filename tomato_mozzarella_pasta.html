    <h1>Tomato Mozarella Pasta</h1>

    <div class="introduction">
      <p>We call this pasta "Emergency Pasta" since it's what we cook if have to
        prepare something fast. It's also our favorite since it's fast, it's fresh, and very satisfying.
        Normally I would start cooking the pasta before I prepare the sauce, since the time it takes me to
        prepare the sauce is how long my pasta cooks, which is more or less 10 minutes. If you're making it
        for the first time though, make sure your pasta won't cook ahead of your sauce. The pasta should be
        poured on the sauce while it's very hot since the parmesan should melt with it, creating a creamy
        sauce. If you need time to prepare the sauce, cook the pasta when the sauce is done.

      <h6>Ingredients:</h6>
      <p>
        1 clove garlic, halved<br>
        a handful of fresh basil<br>
        6-8 cherry tomatoes, cut in quarters <br>
        1 fresh mozzarella, diced <br>
        1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese<br>
        4 tablespoons olive oil <br>
        250g Pasta, preferrably Penne<br>
        salt<br>

      </p>
      <p>Put a tablespoon of salt in boiling water and put the pasta. Set timer, depending on the cooking time
        of the pasta.
        <p>In a big bowl, pour 3 tablespoons of oil, put the garlic, and about a half teaspoon of salt.
          Cut the fresh basil leaves into small pieces and put into the oil mixture. Mix while pressing the
          basil leaves to release more flavor. Pour in the cut tomatoes and mix. Pour in the diced fresh
          mozzarella and mix. Pour in the grated parmesan cheese. You can add a bit more olive oil if the sauce
          is too dry, or more parmesan cheese if you want it thicker. Adjust the salt. <p>
            <p>As soon as the pasta cooks, drain it and pour it immediately in the prepared sauce. Top with
              more parmesan cheese, if desired.
